# Accessing the Command Line on the Flipper Zero

There are [three methods](https://docs.flipper.net/development/cli#HfXTy) to access the
Flipper Zero command line:  
1. Using Flipper Lab
2. Using the web serial terminal
3. Using a serial terminal


## Using a Serial Terminal on Windows
##### Official guide [here](https://docs.flipper.net/development/cli#rnDLl)


You need [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) to
access the Flipper Zero command line on Windows.

* qFlipper can not be running.
* Plug in the Flipper Zero to your PC.
* Go to Device Manager -> Ports (COM & LPT).
* Look at the COM port number of your Flipper Zero connected.
* If there are several COM port numbers, disconnect and connect your Flipper Zero back
  to see the added port number.
* Run the PuTTY application.
* In the opened window, in the Connection type, select Serial.
* In the Serial line field, enter the COM port number (For example, COM3).
* In the Speed field, enter 230400.
* Click the Open button.
