# Building Programs from Source

The term "build from source" means downloading the source code and compiling it
yourself.


## Tarballs

A `.tar.gz` file or `.tar.bz2` file is a *compressed* tarball.  
* The uncompressed extension of a tarball would be `.tar`.  

The tarball contains the source code for an application.  


## Download the Source Code

You found a program you want.  
Find the source code for it (possibly under github's releases) and find the
tarball.  


### Extracting an Archive

* For `.tar.gz` files type:
```bash
tar -xzvf <filename>.tar.gz
```

* For `.tar.bz2` files type:
```bash
tar -xjvf <filename>.tar.bz2
```
