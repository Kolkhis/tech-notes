## Useful Prompts to Add at the End of Your Prompts 


### Useful Questions You Didn't Think Of
This addition is particularly useful when you're getting ChatGPT to act as a teacher when learning
something new.  
Replace `{topic}` with the subject you're learning.
```prompt
Please provide the answers to all of my questions.
Then, imagine you are a student learning {topic}, and think of questions to ask about the current aspect of {topic} we're discussing.
Then, ask and answer those questions as well.
Please do this from now on with each question for the rest of our conversation.
```



### Helping out with notes
This one's helpful for rounding out notes and making sure you're not missing anything.
```prompt
Please examine my notes and make any corrections, 
additions (if I missed any relevant information), 
or any other input that could be relevant to the topic.
 
Please format your response in markdown code blocks.
```
