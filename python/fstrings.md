# Format Strings (f-strings)  

f-strings were (formatted string literals) were introduced in Python 3.6.  
Along with standard format specifiers, f-strings support a set of modifiers  
that affect how the values are represented.  
Here's a breakdown of these modifiers:  

f-string modifiers (`!s`, `!r`, `!a`) control how values are converted to strings.  


## String Casting Modifier - `!s`
* `!s {string}`: Applies `str()` to the variable.  
    * It's used to convert the value to a string.  

```python  
x = 10  
print(f"{x!s}")  # '10' as a string (no quotes)  
```

## Repr Modifier - `!r`

* `!r (representation)`: Applies `repr()` to the variable. 
    * This is used to get the string representation of the value in a way  
      that is usually valid Python syntax.  
    * It shows the quoted string or the precise representation of the object.  

```python  
x = "Hello"  
print(f"{x!r}")  # 'Hello' (with quotes)  
```

## ASCII Modifier (Escaping Non-ASCII characters) - `!a`

* `!a (ASCII)`: Applies `ascii()` to the variable.  
    * Similar to `!r` but escapes the non-ASCII characters in the string returned by `repr()`.  

```python  
x = "Caf√©"  
print(f"{x!a}")  # 'Caf\xe9' (unicode is escaped)  
```

## Format Specifications  

In addition to the modifiers, f-strings allow for detailed formatting specifications.  
You can control width, alignment, padding, number formatting, and more. Here are some examples:  

## Padding and Alignment:  
* `{value:10}`: Right-aligns the value in a field 10 characters wide.  
* `{value:<10}`: Left-aligns the value in a field 10 characters wide.  
* `{value:^10}`: Centers the value in a field 10 characters wide.  
* `{value:_<10}`: Left-aligns the value, padding with underscores.  

## Number Formatting:  
* `{value:.2f}`: Formats a floating-point number to two decimal places.  
* `{value:+.2f}`: Formats a floating-point number to two decimal places, including the sign.  
* `{value:,.2f}`: Includes a comma as a thousand separator.  

## Date and Time Formatting:  
* `{datetime_variable:%Y-%m-%d}`: Formats a datetime object in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.  

## Percentages and Exponents:  
* `{value:.2%}`: Formats a number as a percentage.  
* `{value:.2e}`: Formats a number in scientific notation.

## Printf-Style String Formatting  
String objects have one unique built-in operation: the `%` operator (modulo).  
This is also known as the "string formatting"/"interpolation" operator.  

You can use this to format strings without using f-strings.  
The syntax is `%x` where `x` is a format specifier.  
The format specifier specifies the type of the value (e.g., `%s` for strings).  
```python  
# Dictionary  
print("%(name)s" % {"name": "Jeff"})  
# Single Value  
print("%s" % "Jeff")  
# Tuple  
print("%s" % ("Jeff"))  
```

You can name the variables you want to use in the string by 
using `%(varname)_`, where `_` is a format specifier. 
* `s` for strings, 
* `d` (or `i`) for integers,
* `f` for floats, etc. 
```python  
# Using a single value  
print("%s" % "I'm a string")  

# Using multiple named values:  
print('%(language)s has %(number)03d quote types.' %  
      {'language': "Python", "number": 2})  

print("%(name)s" % {"name": "Jeff"})  
print("%(number)d" % {"number": 3})  
print("%(decimal)f" % {"decimal": 3.14})  

print("%s %d" % ("I'm a string", 77))  
```

You pass in either a single value, a dictionary, or a tuple.  
* If you name a variable in the string, you **must** use a dictionary, 
  using the same name as a key in the dictionary.

When using a tuple, the values are assigned to the variables in the order they appear.
