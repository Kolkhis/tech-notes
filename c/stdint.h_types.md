# Fixed-Width Integer Types


Fixed-width integer types are defined in the C99 standard and later.  

These types allow for declaring integers of a specific width,
ensuring consistency across different platforms and compilers.

## Best Practices

* For general-purpose programming, continue using standard C types
  (`int`, `unsigned`, etc.) when the exact size is not critical, as
  they are often optimized for the speed of the native architecture.

* Use fixed-width integer types when you need exact-size integers with 
  predictable behavior across different platforms.


## Fixed-Width Integer Types

### Signed Integer Types
* `int8_t`, `int16_t`, `int32_t`, `int64_t`:
    * Signed integers of 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits respectively.  
    * They can represent both positive and negative values.  
    * For example, `int8_t` can represent values from -128 to 127.

### Unsigned Integer Types
* `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t`, `uint64_t`:
    * Unsigned integers of 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits respectively.  
    * They cannot represent negative values.  
        * For example, `uint8_t` can represent values from 0 to 255.


## Minimum-Width Integer Types

* Minimum-width signed integer types: `int_least8_t`, `int_least16_t`, `int_least32_t`, `int_least64_t`.  
    * These are the smallest types that have at least the specified bit width.  
    * They are useful when you want to save memory but still need a minimum width.
    * Can represent positive or negative values.

* Minimum-width unsigned integer types: `uint_least8_t`, `uint_least16_t`, `uint_least32_t`, `uint_least64_t`.  
    * Can only represent non-negative values.  


## Fastest Minimum-Width Integer Types

* Fastest minimum-width integer types: `int_fast8_t`, `int_fast16_t`, `int_fast32_t`, `int_fast64_t` and their unsigned counterparts.  
    * These are the fastest types with at least the specified bit width.  
    * They offer a good trade-off between speed and size.
    * Can represent positive or negative values.

* Fastest minimum-width unsigned integer types: `uint_fast8_t`, `uint_fast16_t`, `uint_fast32_t`, `uint_fast64_t` and their unsigned counterparts.  
    * Can only represent non-negative values.  

## Pointer-Sized Integer Types
* Pointer-sized integer types: `intptr_t` and `uintptr_t`.  
    * These are signed and unsigned integer types capable of storing a pointer.
    * Useful for integer-pointer conversions without loss of information.

## Maximum-Width Integer Types
* Maximum-width integer type: `intmax_t` and `uintmax_t`.
    * These are the largest signed and unsigned integers supported.


## Usage
 
To use these types, include the `stdint.h` header file at the 
beginning of your source file:
 
```c
#include <stdint.h>
```

These types are useful in embedded systems programming, cross-platform
development, and anywhere else where the precise size of an integer is 
critical for the correct operation of the software.


## Why the Syntax is Different

The syntax for these types (`uint8_t`, `int32_t`, etc.) is different from
the standard C types (`int`, `long`, etc.) because they are `typedef`s
from the `stdint.h` (or `cstdint` in C++) header file.  

This header file defines these types to ensure that they have the same size and 
range on any platform, fixing the portability issues with the standard C integer
types, can vary in size depending on the compiler and system architecture.
