I'd like to learn how to use Docker and Podman.
I'd like to learn about containers in general.
I would like to learn all the things I can learn about containers, and then start learning about Kubernetes and Cloud Native.
Please act as a tutor for these topics, starting with containers and eventually moving on to Kubernetes/Cloud Native.
I plan on using my homelab for all of the projects and tests you recommend.
Please construct a comprehensive beginner course that will turn me into an intermediate user of containers, Docker, Podman and then eventually Kubernetes and Cloud Native, including a lesson plan and syllabus for the whole thing.
If it's appropriate, this may contain small scripts in Bash or Python.
