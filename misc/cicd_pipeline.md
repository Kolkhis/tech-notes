## What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.

* Continuous Integration (CI): This is the practice of automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.
    The CI process is comprised of automatic tools that assert the new code's correctness before integration.
    A source code version control system, like Git, is often involved.

* Continuous Deployment (CD): This is an automated process that takes validated features from CI and automatically deploys them into the production environment without manual intervention.

## Why Use CI/CD?

* Automated Testing: Every change is automatically tested. If a test fails, you'll know immediately.

* Quick Deployment: Once the code is tested and built, it can be deployed automatically.

* Quality Assurance: Ensures that all code is reviewed and tested, improving code quality.

## Setting Up a Simple CI/CD Pipeline for Shell Scripting

For your homelab, a simple CI/CD pipeline could just be a script that runs ShellCheck on all your shell scripts whenever you make a change. Here's a basic guide to set this up:

### Tools Needed

* Git: To keep track of changes in your scripts.
* ShellCheck: To perform static analysis on your shell scripts.
* A Script to Tie It All Together: A simple shell script can serve as your CI/CD pipeline.


### Steps

1. Install Git and ShellCheck
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git shellcheck
```

1. Initialize a Git repository
Navigate to the directory where your shell scripts are stored and run:
```bash
git init
```

1. Create the CI/CD Script
Create a new shell script, let's call it `cicd_pipeline.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Loop through every shell script in the directory
for script in *.sh; do
    # Run shellcheck on the script
    shellcheck "$script"

    # Check if shellcheck passed or failed
    if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
        echo "$script passed."
    else
        echo "$script failed."
    fi
done
```
