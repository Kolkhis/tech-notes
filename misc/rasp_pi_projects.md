* Network Monitoring: 
    * Use it as a network monitor tool with software like Nagios to keep
      an eye on your home network's health.


## Nagios

Nagios is an open-source monitoring system that enables organizations to
identify and resolve IT infrastructure problems before they affect 
critical business processes.

It can monitor pretty much anything: 
* network protocols
* system metrics
* applications
* services
* among other things. 

It's widely used for network and system monitoring.

## How to Set Up Network Monitoring with Raspberry Pi and Nagios

1.  **Install Raspbian**: First, make sure you have Raspbian (the Raspberry Pi OS) 
    installed on your Raspberry Pi 3.

2.  **Update and Install Dependencies**: Open the terminal and run the following
    commands to update your system and install required packages:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    sudo apt install -y build-essential apache2 apache2-utils libapache2-mod-php \
    php php-gd libgd2-xpm-dev openssl libssl-dev perl libperl-dev \
    daemon wget make unzip
    ```

3.  **Install Nagios**: Download and install Nagios following the instructions
    from their official website.
    
4.  **Configuration**: Once installed, you'll need to configure
    Nagios to monitor your network. 
    * This involves editing configuration files to specify what to 
      monitor (like CPU usage, disk space, etc.).
    
5.  **Web Interface**: Nagios provides a web interface where you can view real-time data, historical data, and notifications.
    
6.  **Test**: Finally, test your setup to make sure everything is working as expected.


### What to Monitor for Network Health

1.  **Bandwidth Usage**: Keep an eye on how much bandwidth different devices are using.
    
2.  **CPU and Memory Usage**: Monitor the CPU and memory usage of devices on your network, 
    especially if you're running servers.
    
3.  **Uptime**: Check how long your devices and services have been running without interruption.
    
4.  **Error Rates**: Monitor for increased rates of errors that could indicate problems.
    
5.  **Security**: Keep an eye out for unauthorized access or unusual activity that 
    could indicate a security breach.


**Alerts**: Nagios can send you alerts if it detects issues, helping you proactively
            manage your homelab.
