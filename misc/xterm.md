# What is xterm?

* **xterm**: 

    * It's a standard terminal emulator for the X Window System,
      a windowing system for bitmap displays common on Unix-like operating systems.

    * xterm was one of the first terminal emulators to support a full range of 
      ANSI escape sequences and is considered the de facto standard for
      emulating terminals in the X Window System.

# Understanding 'xterm Compatibility'

* **What Does 'xterm Compatible' Mean?**

    * Being 'xterm compatible' means that a terminal emulator can correctly 
      interpret the control sequences (ANSI escape codes) used by xterm.

    * This includes a wide range of functions, from basic text styling 
      (like colors and font styles) to more advanced features (like cursor
      positioning, window title changes, and mouse events).
