## Ansible and Terraform

Ansible and Terraform serve very different purposes.

Ansible is more automating server configuration & tasks, where Terraform is automating infrastructure.
You'd use Terraform to spin up an EC2 instance, you'd use Ansible to install nginx on that EC2 instance.
Generally speaking, TF spins up your infrastructure, Ansible configures it
