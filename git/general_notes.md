## Branches:
## Checkout / Switch / Branch

### Creating a New Branch
There are three commands available to create a branch:
```bash
git branch newBranch
git checkout -b newBranch
git switch -c newBranch
```

1. The first command (`branch`) creates a branch named `newBranch`.  
1. The second command (`checkout -b`) creates the branch `newBranch`, and then switches to it.  
1. The third command (`switch -c`) also creates the branch `newBranch` and switches to it.  
    * `switch` was created to replace `checkout`, but `checkout` still has a lot of other uses.
