# **Amazon Simple Storage (Amazon S3)**

- Store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere.
- Store any type of data.

To store data in Amazon S3, you work with resources called "buckets" and "objects."

- **Buckets**: A bucket is a container for objects.
- **Objects**: An object is any type of file and any metadata that describes that file.

The solution uses an Amazon S3 bucket to host a static website.  
No need to manage any web servers.

Client-side scripts and CSS are uploaded into the bucket with an HTML file.  
You can configure any of your S3 buckets as a static website.
