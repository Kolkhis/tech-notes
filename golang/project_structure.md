1. **cmd:** The `cmd` directory contains executable main packages
   for different applications or command-line utilities.  
    * Each subdirectory inside `cmd` represents an individual application or utility.  
    * For instance, you might have `myapp` for a web server and `mycli` for a command-line tool.
    
2. **internal:** The `internal` directory contains private packages that should
   not be imported by external projects.  
    * This directory helps enforce encapsulation and avoids accidental use by external code.
    
3. **pkg:** The `pkg` directory contains public packages that can be
   imported and used by external projects.  
    * It should contain reusable libraries and code that can be shared across 
      different parts of your project or potentially across multiple projects.
    
4. **api:** The `api` directory can contain code related to defining API contracts,
   such as gRPC or REST API definitions, if applicable.
    
5. **web:** The `web` directory can contain web-related code.  
    * E.g., front-end assets or templates if your project includes a web application.
    
6. **config:** The `config` directory can store configuration files.
    * E.g., `.yaml`, `.json`, or `.toml` files used by your application.
    
7. **scripts:** The `scripts` directory can contain helper scripts for tasks like
   building, testing, or setting up the project.
    
8. **tests:** The `tests` directory contains unit tests, integration tests, and
   other test-related files.
    
9. **README.md:** A Markdown file with project documentation, including instructions
   for building, testing, and running the project.
    
10. **go.mod:** The `go.mod` file is used to manage Go dependencies for the project.
