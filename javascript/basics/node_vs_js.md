# JavaScript vs Node.js

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily known for its role in 
web dev.

- **Environment**
    * Originally designed to run in web browsers, JavaScript is used to make web pages
      interactive and dynamic.
    * It executes on the client-side (in the user's web browser).
- **Capabilities**
    * In the browser, JavaScript can manipulate HTML content, handle events, perform
      animations, and much more.
- **ECMAScript Standard**
    * JavaScript follows the ECMAScript (ES) standards, with various versions
      (ES5, ES6/ES2015, etc.) introducing new features and syntax improvements.

### Node.js

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be run on the server side.

- **Server-Side Runtime**
    * Node.js enables JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting.  
    * This allows developers to build full-stack applications using only JavaScript.
- **Built on V8 Engine**
    * Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same runtime used in Google Chrome for executing JavaScript.
- **NPM (Node Package Manager)**
    * Node.js comes with npm, a powerful package manager, which provides access to a large number of libraries and tools.
- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**
    * Node.js is designed for asynchronous, non-blocking operations, making it highly efficient for I/O-intensive tasks.
- **Use Cases**
    * Used for building various types of applications like web servers, REST APIs, real-time chat applications, and more.

### Key Differences

1. **Execution Environment**:
   - JavaScript is traditionally run in web browsers, while Node.js enables
     JavaScript to run on the server.
   
2. **APIs and Libraries**:
   - JavaScript in the browser has APIs for DOM manipulation, which are not available
     in Node.js.
   - Node.js includes APIs for server-side functionalities like file system,
     network, streams, and more, which are not available in browser-based JavaScript.

3. **Concurrent Processing**:
   - Node.js excels in handling asynchronous operations, making it suitable
     for I/O-bound tasks, data streaming, etc.

4. **NPM Ecosystem**:
   - Node.js has access to an extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools through 
     npm, vastly expanding its capabilities beyond what's possible in browser-based
     JavaScript.

### Conclusion

While JavaScript is a programming language that runs in browsers, Node.js
is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be used for server-side development.

Node.js enables full-stack development with a single programming language.
