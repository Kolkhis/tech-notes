    * Use it as a network monitor tool with software like Nagios to keep
      an eye on your home network's health.


## Nagios for Network Monitoring

Nagios is an open-source monitoring system that enables organizations to
identify and resolve IT infrastructure problems before they affect 
critical business processes.

It can monitor pretty much anything: 
* Network protocols
* System metrics
* Applications
* Services  
etc.  

It's widely used for network and system monitoring.  

### How to Set Up Network Monitoring with Raspberry Pi and Nagios

1.  Install Raspbian: First, make sure you have Raspbian (the Raspberry Pi OS) 
    installed on your Raspberry Pi 3.

2.  Update and Install Dependencies: Open the terminal and run the following
    commands to update your system and install required packages:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    sudo apt install -y build-essential apache2 apache2-utils libapache2-mod-php \
    php php-gd libgd2-xpm-dev openssl libssl-dev perl libperl-dev \
    daemon wget make unzip
    ```

3.  Install Nagios: Download and install Nagios following the instructions
    from their official website.
    
4.  Configuration: Once installed, you'll need to configure
    Nagios to monitor your network. 
    * This involves editing configuration files to specify what to 
      monitor (like CPU usage, disk space, etc.).
    
5.  Web Interface: Nagios provides a web interface where you can view real-time data, historical data, and notifications.
    
6.  Test: Finally, test your setup to make sure everything is working as expected.


### What to Monitor for Network Health

* Bandwidth Usage: Keep an eye on how much bandwidth different devices are using.
    
* CPU and Memory Usage: Monitor the CPU and memory usage of devices on your network, 
  especially if you're running servers.
    
* Uptime: Check how long your devices and services have been running without interruption.
    
* Error Rates: Monitor for increased rates of errors that could indicate problems.
    
* Security: Keep an eye out for unauthorized access or unusual activity that 
  could indicate a security breach.


* Alerts: Nagios can send you alerts if it detects issues, helping you proactively manage your homelab.
